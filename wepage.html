    <p> In one of the largest religious gatherings, the MahaKumbh Mela is underway in the northern part of India.  The festival is marked by millions of Hindu devotees pouring in from across the subcontinent to take a dip in the Ganges River, which is believed to cleanse one's sins. </p>
         
    <p>
      The Mahakumbh Mela festival starting January 13 2025 will conclude on February 26, and is considered particularly auspicious as it takes place once every twelve years at Prayagraj, where the three rivers - Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers meet in India. Prayagraj is located in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous of all Indian States.
